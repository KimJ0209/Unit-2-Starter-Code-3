            <h1>Section 2: The preformances</h1>
            <h4> Being a K-pop idol seems easy to the people's naked eye but behind the scences, it's extremely hard. On the outside, both male and female idols just have to dance, sing and look pretty. What's so hard about that? A LOT, imagine trying to sing and dance without messing up your hair, not to mention the choreography they have to dance to is extremely tiring. When idols are now on stage infront of people, they can't do anything even if they feel sick or have a medical emergencies such as a broken foot, they can get off stage but as soon as they get treatment they immediately have to get back on stage to perform even if they still feel pain/sick. The only reason why a concert would stop if some accident happens on stage. </h4>
            <a> There has been incidents where the idols were injured badly </a>
            <p>

            <h1>Section 3: The life of the idols</h1>
            <p>In order to be an Idol, you would have to go through training to be ready for debut, sounds kinda easy right? It wasn't really easy. The idols have to go through a lot of expectations since South Korea is known for it's Beauty Standard. In the Us the Beauty Standard is to be slim, be blonde/brunette, blue eyes etc but in Korea it's impossible to fit into the Beauty Standard, small v-shaped face, fair skin, symmetrical eyebrows, a slim body, and double eyelids and so much more now imagine what idols have to go through.</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9OM0kPbLrA">Momo talking about her diet and Sana passing out in Sauna </a>
           <p> One example of this was when Idol Momo was forced to lose 7kg in a week, her diet was one ice cube and workout all the time, she was scared to sleep because she was scared of dying due to not eating and only eat one ice cube. When the whole group was forced to lose weight they all went to a sauna to lose weight when one of the idols Sana passed out inside the sauna</p>
            <p> 2 members  of the same group went on hiatus in 2019-2021 the members were Jeongyeon and Mina and what do they have in common? They went on hiatus because of health issues and anxiety </p> <a> *A Hiatus is when an someone or something has a pause in activities/process*</a>
            <p> When Mina came back in early 2020 people welcomed her back warmly, same thing with Jeongyeon in 2021</p>
            <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFeD5tPtRA"> Mina back from hiatus</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KiTQhzSeU2k"> Jeongyeon back from hiatus </a>
            </p>
            Seems like everyone is happy right? not really. When Mina came back nothing really changed besides her confidence and no shame in that but when jeongyeon came back, people were sending hate to her due to her weight gain. She gained weight due to the pills she was taking for her health but people just kept calling her names such as fat, pig, ugly etc and that can cause more harm.
            <p> in some cases of bullying/hate towards an idol they can get kicked out of their companies because another way idols have gotten their career taken away is due to false rumors such as dating rumors, bulling rumors etc. Most known idols who've gotten kicked out due to rumors were Garam and Soojin. </p> <p>Sadly there are cases of Bullying/hate towards an idol where it get's to much for the idol and they sadly end it all as an escape from the bullying, it's not always bullying but it's majority of idols who have died were due to suicide. Most well known idols who have died due to suicide were </p> 
            
            <ul>    <li> Lee Hye-Ryeon aka U;Nee (1981-2007) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Lee Seo-hyun (1978-2008) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Park Yong-ha (1977-2010) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Ahn So Jin (1992-2015) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Kim Jonghyun (1990-2017) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Sulli (1994-2019) </li> </ul>
            <ul>    <li> Goo Hara (1991-2019) </li> </ul>
            <p> Being an K-pop Idol is hard despite people comparing it to US idols, but in general just being someone famous is hard. I hope i can shed some light into the K-pop industry and how toxic it is on the inside and the outside. I feel like it's better to focus on the idols and to make sure they are happy and are healthy.  </p>
